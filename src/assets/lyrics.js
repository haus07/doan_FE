I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya
All I could want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I'm in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn't hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)

Hand in my hand because I'm yours
(I can't) I can't pretend, I can't ignore, you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done being distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest, with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight

Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbing even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leaning
Couldn't even breathe, and
For that money, I was fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night

Leaving, leaving into the night
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Phillip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need

Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big, got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road
Rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga

Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night

Leaving, leaving into the night
20 mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin', and
Goin' on tour is my vacation
Every month, another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
So a nigga leaving
